It derives some general results giving properties for the stationary process mean, variance and correlation structure, and conditions for stationarity. These results highlight similarities with and differences from the Gaussian AR(1) model, and unify many separate results appearing in the literature. Examples illustrate the wide range of properties that can appear under the conditional linear autoregressive assumption. These results are used in analysing three real datasets, illustrating general methods of estimation, model diagnostics and model selection. In particular, the theoretical results can be used to develop diagnostics for deciding if a time series can be modelled by some linear autoregressive model, and for selecting among several candidate models.},

This implies existence of initial values such that the joint process is strictly stationary and β-mixing. In addition to this, conditions for the existence of moments are also obtained, and extensions to the case of nonstationary initial values are provided. All these results are applied to a general model that includes as special cases various first-order generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models with possibly complicated nonlinear structures. The results only require mild moment assumptions and in some cases provide necessary and sufficient conditions for geometric ergodicity.},

Asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters is established under some mild assumptions. These models are applied to two examples; the first is the number of transactions per minute of Ericsson stock and the second is related to return times of extreme events of Goldman Sachs Group stock.},

It is shown that the INARCH model studied by earlier researchers is a special case. Conditions for weak and strict stationarity of this model are also given in our paper. Some basic properties of this model are shown to be parallel to those of the classical autoregressive model. Three distribution based methods and two non-distribution based methods are presented for parameter estimation. These methods are compared in a simulation study for the conditional overdispersed situation with an integer-valued pure time series of order one. Finally, this model is applied to the motivating example.},

Based on popularity of the generalized Poisson distribution in regression count models and of Poisson INGARCH models in time series analysis, we introduce a generalized Poisson INGARCH model, which can account for both overdispersion and underdispersion. Compared with the double Poisson INGARCH model, conditions for the existence and ergodicity of such a process are easily given. We analyze the autocorrelation structure and also derive expressions for moments of order 1 and 2. We consider the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters and establish their consistency and asymptotic normality. We apply the proposed model to one overdispersed real example and one underdispersed real example, respectively, which indicates that the proposed methodology performs better than other conventional model-based methods in the literature.},

This allows almost effortless proofs of the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution as well as of absolute regularity of the count process. As our main result, we construct a coupling of the original process and a model-based bootstrap counterpart. Using a contraction property of the Markov kernel of the coupled process we obtain bootstrap consistency for different types of statistics.},

We provide a careful derivation of the model and extend the model class in two directions. First, we model the disease transmission between age–gender strata, in addition to space and time. Second, we use our model for inference on effective local reproductive numbers. For the hand, foot and mouth data, for each of the six age–gender strata we consider that transmission is greatest between individuals within the same strata, with also relatively high transmission between individuals of the same age group but the opposite gender. The local reproductive numbers show strong seasonality, and between-area differences.},

Such predictive distributions are currently often deemed intractable by the literature and existing approximation methods are usually time consuming and induce approximation errors. In this paper, we propose a Taylor's expansion algorithm for these predictive distributions, which is both exact and fast. Through extensive simulation exercises, we demonstrate its advantages with respect to existing methods in terms of the computational gain and/or precision.},

We establish existence, uniqueness, finiteness of moments, and give formulas for the autocovariance function as well as for the joint moment-generating function. Furthermore, we derive a branching-process–as well as an AR(∞)–and an MA(∞) representation for the model. We compare Hawkes process properties with their INAR(∞) counterparts. Given a Hawkes process N, in the main theorem of the paper we construct an INAR(∞)-based family of point processes and prove its convergence to N. This connection between INAR and Hawkes models will be relevant in applications.},

We consider the endemic-epidemic framework, a class of autoregressive models for infectious disease surveillance counts, and replace the default autoregression on counts from the previous time period with more flexible weighting schemes inspired by discrete-time serial interval distributions. We employ three different parametric formulations, each with an additional unknown weighting parameter estimated via a profile likelihood approach, and compare them to an unrestricted nonparametric approach. The new methods are illustrated in a univariate analysis of dengue fever incidence in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a spatiotemporal study of viral gastroenteritis in the 12 districts of Berlin. We assess the predictive performance of the suggested models and several reference models at various forecast horizons. In both applications, the performance of the endemic-epidemic models is considerably improved by the proposed weighting schemes.},

  abstract = {Count data are primarily categorised as cross-sectional, time series, and panel. Over the past decade, Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB) models have been used widely to analyse cross-sectional and time series count data, and random effect and fixed effect Poisson and NB models have been used to analyse panel count data. However, recent literature suggests that although the underlying distributional assumptions of these models are appropriate for cross-sectional count data, they are not capable of taking into account the effect of serial correlation often found in pure time series count data. Real-valued time series models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, introduced by Box and Jenkins have been used in many applications over the last few decades. However, when modelling non-negative integer-valued data such as traffic accidents at a junction over time, Box and Jenkins models may be inappropriate. This is mainly due to the normality assumption of errors in the ARIMA model. Over the last few years, a new class of time series models known as integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) Poisson models, has been studied by many authors. This class of models is particularly applicable to the analysis of time series count data as these models hold the properties of Poisson regression and able to deal with serial correlation, and therefore offers an alternative to the real-valued time series models. The primary objective of this paper is to introduce the class of INAR models for the time series analysis of traffic accidents in Great Britain. Different types of time series count data are considered: aggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units of observation are relatively large (e.g., Great Britain and years) and disaggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units are relatively small (e.g., congestion charging zone and months). The performance of the INAR models is compared with the class of Box and Jenkins real-valued models. The results suggest that the performance of these two classes of models is quite similar in terms of coefficient estimates and goodness of fit for the case of aggregated time series traffic accident data. This is because the mean of the counts is high in which case the normal approximations and the ARIMA model may be satisfactory. However, the performance of INAR Poisson models is found to be much better than that of the ARIMA model for the case of the disaggregated time series traffic accident data where the counts is relatively low. The paper ends with a discussion on the limitations of INAR models to deal with the seasonality and unobserved heterogeneity.},
