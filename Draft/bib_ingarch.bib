It derives some general results giving properties for the stationary process mean, variance and correlation structure, and conditions for stationarity. These results highlight similarities with and differences from the Gaussian AR(1) model, and unify many separate results appearing in the literature. Examples illustrate the wide range of properties that can appear under the conditional linear autoregressive assumption. These results are used in analysing three real datasets, illustrating general methods of estimation, model diagnostics and model selection. In particular, the theoretical results can be used to develop diagnostics for deciding if a time series can be modelled by some linear autoregressive model, and for selecting among several candidate models.},

Conditions under which geometric ergodicity of the unobservable component is inherited by the joint process formed of the two components are given. This implies existence of initial values such that the joint process is strictly stationary and β-mixing. In addition to this, conditions for the existence of moments are also obtained, and extensions to the case of nonstationary initial values are provided. All these results are applied to a general model that includes as special cases various first-order generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models with possibly complicated nonlinear structures. The results only require mild moment assumptions and in some cases provide necessary and sufficient conditions for geometric ergodicity.},

It is assumed that the observations follow a one-parameter exponential family of distributions given an accompanying process that evolves as a function of lagged observations. We employ an iterated random function approach and a special coupling technique to show that, under suitable conditions on the parameter space, the conditional mean process is a geometric moment contracting Markov chain and that the observation process is absolutely regular with geometrically decaying coefficients. Asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters is established under some mild assumptions. These models are applied to two examples; the first is the number of transactions per minute of Ericsson stock and the second is related to return times of extreme events of Goldman Sachs Group stock.},

It is shown that the INARCH model studied by earlier researchers is a special case. Conditions for weak and strict stationarity of this model are also given in our paper. Some basic properties of this model are shown to be parallel to those of the classical autoregressive model. Three distribution based methods and two non-distribution based methods are presented for parameter estimation. These methods are compared in a simulation study for the conditional overdispersed situation with an integer-valued pure time series of order one. Finally, this model is applied to the motivating example.},

  abstract = {Overdispersion in time series of counts is very common and has been well studied by many authors, but the opposite phenomenon of underdispersion may also be encountered in real applications and receives little attention. Based on popularity of the generalized Poisson distribution in regression count models and of Poisson INGARCH models in time series analysis, we introduce a generalized Poisson INGARCH model, which can account for both overdispersion and underdispersion. Compared with the double Poisson INGARCH model, conditions for the existence and ergodicity of such a process are easily given. We analyze the autocorrelation structure and also derive expressions for moments of order 1 and 2. We consider the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters and establish their consistency and asymptotic normality. We apply the proposed model to one overdispersed real example and one underdispersed real example, respectively, which indicates that the proposed methodology performs better than other conventional model-based methods in the literature.},
